    *  This README was copied from a README sent with the source of a 
    *  flash plugin for some VisIt 1.6.x.  It's been changed a bit.

    PREPARATION
    -----------
    Directory "FLASH" contains this README file and the source code for the 
    VisIt FLASH database plugin.  Place directory "FLASH" in the directory 
    where you want to build the plugin.  You'll need HDF5 installed somewhere 
    as well.

    Note that if you run VisIt in client/server mode, you will need to
    make sure to install the plugin on both the client machine (usually
    your desktop machine) and the server.

    BUILDING
    --------
    The first two of the three commands, below, are part of the VisIt release
    package, and are in <visit_dir>/bin.
    
    Execute them in the order shown.  They will build the plugin in this 
    "FLASH" directory, and install the plugin libraries in 
    ~/.visit/<arch>/plugins/databases.
        % xml2info -clobber FLASH.xml
        % xml2makefile -clobber FLASH.xml
        % make
    (Instead of "make", you may have to execute 
    "make HDF5_INCLUDE=-I<HDF5_dir>/include HDF5_LIB=<HDF5_dir>/lib/libhdf5.a".)
    To uninstall the plugin from the directory in which this README file 
    exists, issue the following command:
        % make clean
    You can then re-install it by re-running the commands used to install
    it.

    When you start VisIt, it looks in ~/.visit/<arch>/plugins for any
    plugins you have installed in your home directory and then it looks
    in the public installation directory. In this way, plugins in your
    home directory override plugins in the public directory. You can
    disable this behavior by adding '-publicpluginsonly' on the command
    line to launch VisIt.
